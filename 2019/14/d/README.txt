--- Day 13, part 1 ---

For part two I logged output, took sample averages the (+nn)
column from the log into a new log, took sample averages from
*that* log, and guessed several times to constrain the averages
within this pipeline.

No idea at all how this is seriously supposed to be done,
although I imagine that a speedier part1 solution would help.
