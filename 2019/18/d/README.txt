--- Day 18, failure ---

This gets an answer that's wrong, after 20 minutes.

I give up.

--- Two days later, part 1 and 2 ---

I kept coming back to this and finally managed it, actually
getting the gold star *during* my work on day 20.

Lesson learned:

  BFS != DFS with a 'seen' cache

This is still far, far slower than what other people are
managing.
