--- Day 20, part 1 & 2 ---

The trickiest part of today was the portal-label handling. With
part1 it just took a lot of time for me to handle that. With
part2 I was stymied for a while with a bug in portal labels.

This is using fixed-sized arrays after the awful day 18
experience with bad performance, but this comes at the cost
that unit tests are a little bit more annoying.
