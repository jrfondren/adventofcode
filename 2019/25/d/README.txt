--- Day 25, part 1 ---

Part 1 only. Part 2 is "do you have the other stars?"

Nice gentle end to the contest. I ranked for part 1, and
would've easily ranked for part 2 if I hadn't ragequit over
the completely inappropriate day 22 part 2. Seems that people
were very slow to fill up the scoreboard today.

... Could it be because it's Christmas? ... nah. They must've
been overthinking the puzzle, since every prior 'playable'
puzzle wasn't realistically solvable interactively.
