# 2019, Advent of D

The non-D solutions under 2019/\*/d/ are not mine: they are all taken from
anonymous postings, with very minor modifications. These are usually for
"rewrite it in D" fun: for example, 2019/3/d/crystal.cr is a nice-looking and
decently-performing Crystal solution, and accompanying it is
2019/3/d/d\_crystal.d , a D solution in the exact style of the Crystal
solution.

# 2018, Advent of Ada

Most of these solutions are missing for now, and will be added later.
